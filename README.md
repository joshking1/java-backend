# Summary
Unit Tests: Validate the functionality of individual methods or classes in isolation (e.g., UserServiceTest).

Integration Tests: Validate the interaction between multiple components and ensure they work together correctly (e.g., UserRepositoryIntegrationTest and UserServiceIntegrationTest).

Controller Tests: Validate that the API endpoints are functioning correctly and interacting properly with the service layer (e.g., UserControllerTest).

These tests are crucial for ensuring that your application is robust, reliable, and behaves as expected in different scenarios.
